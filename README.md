👋 Hi, I'm Bharath.V

📍 As for my past, I've played Clash of Clans at almost the highest level for 4+ years. During this period I've met a lot of people from around the globe and this has definitely helped me improve some of my skills.
   In the future I'd like to use this as my foundation and start exploring the different genres of CS and everything around it.
   
📚 I'm currently pursuing B.Tech CSE in University College of Engineering, Kariavattom. Love CS, Badminton, Geography, and Clash of Clans.

🔗 As for my Skills, my specialities are Good and Effective Communication, Analysis, Leadership etc
   Decent with Python
   Fast learner looking to explore this vast field!
